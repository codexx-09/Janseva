    <p> </p>Welcome to Janseva, a transparent, responsive, and citizen-centric Public Grievance Portal
    designed to
    empower every individual with a voice. In a world where civic issues often go unnoticed, Janseva provides a
    structured platform for the public to register complaints, share grievances, and contribute to the development of
    a cleaner, safer, and more accountable society.

    Janseva bridges the communication gap between citizens and local authorities. Whether it’s a pothole on your
    street, a malfunctioning streetlight, uncollected garbage, or water leakage, your complaint deserves attention—and
    we make sure it gets it. Our goal is simple: make public services better, faster, and more efficient by making
    your feedback matter.

    <h2>
       Why Janseva? 
    </h2>
    In many cities and towns, government offices are overwhelmed, and traditional complaint processes are outdated or
    time-consuming. People often hesitate to report problems due to lack of awareness, trust, or follow-up. Janseva
    eliminates these barriers by offering a digital, user-friendly, and accessible platform where every citizen can
    easily submit a complaint in just a few clicks.

    We understand that real change begins at the ground level. Janseva ensures your issues reach the right department by
    intelligently categorizing and forwarding each complaint to the appropriate civic body. You can track your complaint
    status, receive updates, and even add photos or location details for clarity. <br>
    <h2>
     How Janseva Works 
    </h2>
    Simple Interface: Our web portal is designed for users of all ages. Whether you are a student, a homemaker, or a
    senior citizen, you can easily navigate and submit your complaint.

    Complaint Categories: Choose from multiple categories like Roads, Sanitation, Electricity, Water, Noise Pollution,
    and more.

    Live Tracking: Get real-time updates about the status of your complaint.

    Transparency: Each complaint is assigned a unique ID, allowing users to track progress and follow up if necessary.

    Admin Dashboard: Authorized officials can view, prioritize, and act upon complaints from a central panel. <br>

    <h2>
       Our Mission 
    </h2>
    Our mission is to make governance participatory, accountable, and transparent. We believe that by giving every
    citizen the power to report civic issues, we foster a culture of responsibility both in the community and in
    administrative bodies. Janseva isn’t just a complaint portal—it’s a step toward smart governance and digital
    democracy. <br>

    <h2>
       Future Vision 
    </h2>
    We are constantly evolving. In the coming months, Janseva aims to:

    Launch a mobile app for even easier access.

    Integrate with local municipalities and urban governance systems.

    Use data analytics to highlight problem zones and improve city planning.

    Enable SMS/email updates for complaint resolution.

    <h2>
       Join the Movement 
    </h2>
    By using Janseva, you're not just reporting a problem—you're becoming a part of the solution. Your complaints help
    improve infrastructure, reduce hazards, and make communities more livable for everyone.

    Together, let’s build a responsive and responsible society—one complaint at a time.
